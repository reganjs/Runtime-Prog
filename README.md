# Runtime-Prog
C++ program that creates a const whose value is determined at runtime by reading the time when the program starts. In a separate function,  the program creates two arrays of 10,000 doubles. Initialize the first array with sequential integral values starting with 100, and initialize the second array with the same numbers, but in reverse order (i.e., the first array would contain 100, 101, 102b&amp; while the second array contains 10,099, 10,098, 10,097b&amp;). Loop through both arrays using a single loop, and multiply the corresponding array elements from each array together and display the result. Read the time when the program completes the multiplication, and compute and display the elapsed time. Do not use inline functions in this program.
